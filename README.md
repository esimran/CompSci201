# CompSci201
This is home to all of the projects for Computer Science 201 (Java). The first project I made was nbody, which takes a text file and images and converts them into a basic gravity simulator. Next is Markov, which takes text, then creates randomly generated text using the words found in the input text. The most recent project is percolation, which in essence takes an NxN grid and determines the average minimum number of squares that need to be "open" for a hypothetical source of water from the top to make its way to the bottom of the grid. Percolation is pretty cool. I also put the code for random class assignments that I have for sake of completion.
The goal is to have a website that has a useable interface for all of them, but as of now, have all the raw Java code.

Also added Autocomplete (basic search engine that suggests words based off of spelling) and Huffman (compression algorithm). Repository will be removed before CS201 in the fall begins.
