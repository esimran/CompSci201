# CompSci201
This is home to all of the projects for Computer Science 201 in Java. The first project I made was nbody, which takes a text file and images and converts them into a basic gravity simulator. Next is Markov, which takes text, then creates randomly generated text using the words found in the input text. THe most recent preojct is percolation, which in essence takes an NxN grid and determines the average minimum number of squares that need to be "open" for a hypothetical source of water from the top to make its way to the bottom of the grid. Percolation is pretty cool.
